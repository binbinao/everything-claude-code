# 🧪 TDD Masterclass

Welcome to the TDD Masterclass! In this tutorial, you'll master the art of Test-Driven Development using ECC's tdd-guide agent.

## 🎯 What is TDD?

**Test-Driven Development** is a software development approach where you:

1. **🔴 RED** - Write a failing test first
2. **🟢 GREEN** - Write the minimum code to pass the test
3. **🔵 REFACTOR** - Improve the code while keeping tests green

This cycle ensures your code is always tested and you're building exactly what's needed.

## 🎮 Try the TDD Command

<CommandSimulator 
  availableCommands={['/tdd', '/tdd --feature="auth"', '/tdd --fix="bug-123"']}
  commandOutputs={{
    '/tdd': '🧪 TDD Guide activated!\n\nI\'m ready to guide you through test-driven development.\n\nUsage:\n  /tdd --feature="feature-name"\n  /tdd --fix="bug-id"\n\nWhat would you like to build or fix?',
    '/tdd --feature="auth"': '🧪 TDD Guide: User Authentication Feature\n\n📋 Test Plan:\n1. Test user registration validation\n2. Test password hashing\n3. Test login flow\n4. Test session management\n\nLet\'s start with the first test...\n\n🔴 RED Phase: Writing failing test for user registration',
    '/tdd --fix="bug-123"': '🧪 TDD Guide: Bug Fix Mode\n\n🐛 Analyzing bug-123...\n\nFirst, let\'s write a test that reproduces the bug.\nThis test should FAIL with the current code.\n\n🔴 RED Phase: Creating reproduction test...'
  }}
/>

## 📚 The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

<StepByStep 
  title="TDD Cycle: Building a Calculator"
  steps={[
    {
      title: '🔴 RED: Write a Failing Test',
      description: 'Start by writing a test for functionality that doesn\'t exist yet. This test MUST fail.',
      code: `// calculator.test.ts
import { add } from './calculator'

describe('Calculator', () => {
  it('should add two numbers', () => {
    expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5)
  })
})`,
      tip: 'Run the test now - it should fail because add() doesn\'t exist yet!'
    },
    {
      title: '🟢 GREEN: Write Minimum Code',
      description: 'Write the simplest code that makes the test pass. Don\'t over-engineer!',
      code: `// calculator.ts
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}`,
      tip: 'Resist the urge to add extra features. Just make the test pass!'
    },
    {
      title: '🔵 REFACTOR: Improve the Code',
      description: 'Now that tests are green, improve code quality without changing behavior.',
      code: `// calculator.ts (refactored)
/**
 * Adds two numbers together
 * @param a - First number
 * @param b - Second number
 * @returns Sum of a and b
 */
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}`,
      tip: 'Add documentation, improve naming, extract functions - but keep tests green!'
    },
    {
      title: '🔄 REPEAT: Next Feature',
      description: 'Now add another test and repeat the cycle!',
      code: `// Add to calculator.test.ts
it('should subtract two numbers', () => {
  expect(subtract(5, 3)).toBe(2)
})`,
      tip: 'Each cycle should be small and focused. 5-10 minutes per cycle is ideal.'
    }
  ]}
/>

## 💻 Interactive Code Lab

Try writing your own TDD cycle! Start with a failing test:

<CodePlayground 
  title="TDD Lab: String Utilities"
  language="typescript"
  initialCode={`// Step 1: Write a failing test
// Test: capitalize('hello') should return 'Hello'

import { capitalize } from './stringUtils'

describe('StringUtils', () => {
  it('should capitalize first letter', () => {
    expect(capitalize('hello')).toBe('Hello')
  })
})

// Step 2: Now write the function to make it pass!
// export function capitalize(str: string): string {
//   // Your code here
// }
`}
/>

## 🎯 TDD Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Write the **smallest possible test** first
- Run tests **frequently** (after every change)
- **Commit** after each green phase
- Keep the **refactor phase short**
- Name tests **descriptively**

### DON'T ❌
- Write implementation before tests
- Write multiple tests at once
- Skip the refactor phase
- Test implementation details
- Make tests too complex

## ❓ Knowledge Check

<Quiz 
  question="In TDD, when should you write the implementation code?"
  options={[
    'Before writing any tests',
    'After writing a failing test',
    'At the start of the project',
    'Only during code review'
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="In TDD, you always write a failing test FIRST (RED phase), then write the minimum code needed to make it pass (GREEN phase). This ensures you're only writing code that's actually needed."
/>

<Quiz 
  question="What should you do in the REFACTOR phase?"
  options={[
    'Add new features',
    'Write more tests',
    'Improve code quality without changing behavior',
    'Delete failing tests'
  ]}
  correctAnswer={2}
  explanation="The REFACTOR phase is for improving code quality (better names, documentation, extracting functions) while keeping all tests passing. Never change behavior during refactoring!"
/>

<Quiz 
  question="How long should a typical TDD cycle take?"
  options={[
    '1-2 hours',
    '30-60 minutes',
    '5-10 minutes',
    '1 full day'
  ]}
  correctAnswer={2}
  explanation="A typical TDD cycle should be 5-10 minutes. Small, frequent cycles give faster feedback and make it easier to identify where bugs are introduced. If a cycle takes longer, break it down!"
/>
