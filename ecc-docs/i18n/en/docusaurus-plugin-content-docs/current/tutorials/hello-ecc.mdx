# 🎯 Hello ECC - Your First Command

Welcome to your first interactive ECC tutorial! In this lesson, you'll learn how to use your first ECC command.

## 🎮 Try the Command Simulator

Let's start by experiencing ECC commands. Type a command below or click on the available ones:

<CommandSimulator 
  availableCommands={['/plan', '/tdd', '/e2e', '/code-review']}
  commandOutputs={{
    '/plan': '🎯 Planning mode activated!\n\nI will create a detailed implementation plan for your feature.\n\nWhat would you like to build today?',
    '/tdd': '🧪 TDD Guide activated!\n\nLet me walk you through the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:\n\n1. 🔴 Red: Write a failing test\n2. 🟢 Green: Write code to make it pass\n3. 🔵 Refactor: Improve the code',
    '/e2e': '🎭 E2E Runner activated!\n\nI will help you test user flows with Playwright.\n\nWhat flow would you like to test?',
    '/code-review': '🔍 Code Review mode!\n\nI will analyze your code for:\n- Code quality\n- Security issues\n- Performance concerns\n- Best practices'
  }}
/>

## 📚 Step-by-Step Guide: Your First /plan Command

Follow these steps to master the `/plan` command:

<StepByStep 
  title="Using the /plan Command"
  steps={[
    {
      title: 'Open Claude Code',
      description: 'Make sure you have Claude Code installed and open it in your project directory.',
      tip: 'You can type /help in the chat to verify'
    },
    {
      title: 'Type /plan',
      description: 'In the Claude Code chat, type /plan followed by what you want to build.',
      code: '/plan Create a user authentication system',
      tip: 'Be specific about what you want!'
    },
    {
      title: 'Review the Plan',
      description: 'Claude will generate a detailed implementation plan with phases, risks, and time estimates.',
      tip: 'You can ask for modifications before confirming'
    },
    {
      title: 'Confirm and Execute',
      description: 'Say "yes" or "proceed" to start implementing the plan.',
      tip: 'Claude will systematically work through each phase'
    }
  ]}
/>

## 💻 Hands-On: Configuration Example

Here's an ECC configuration example. Try modifying it:

<CodePlayground 
  title="ECC CLAUDE.md Configuration"
  language="markdown"
  initialCode={`# ECC Configuration Example

## Commands
- /plan - Create implementation plans
- /tdd - Test-driven development guide
- /e2e - End-to-end testing

## Agents
- planner: Complex feature planning
- tdd-guide: TDD guidance
- e2e-runner: Playwright testing

## Quick Start
1. Type /plan to start planning
2. Confirm the plan
3. Watch the magic happen!`}
/>

## ❓ Knowledge Check

Let's test your understanding:

<Quiz 
  question="What command should you use to create a detailed implementation plan?"
  options={[
    '/plan',
    '/build',
    '/create',
    '/make'
  ]}
  correctAnswer={0}
  explanation="The /plan command activates the planner agent, which creates a comprehensive implementation plan with phases, risks, and time estimates."
/>

<Quiz 
  question="What are the three phases of TDD (Test-Driven Development)?"
  options={[
    'Write, Test, Deploy',
    'Red, Green, Refactor',
    'Plan, Code, Review',
    'Build, Test, Release'
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="TDD follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle: first write a failing test (Red), then write code to make it pass (Green), and finally improve the code (Refactor)."
/>
